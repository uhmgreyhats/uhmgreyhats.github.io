Hello everyone!

Since the start of the school year is only a few days away, so I just wanted to write a post about our plans for the school semester.

This semester, the club plans to compete in the following competitions.

1) [CSAW 2017](https://ctf.csaw.io/)
2) [HACC](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/)
3) [NCL Fall 2017](https://www.nationalcyberleague.org/fall-season)

These competitions will be the main ones we focus on, but other ones will definitely be done on the side for learning purposes.

We also plan to be more involved in the community by attending more local events and collaborating with other clubs/organizations.
